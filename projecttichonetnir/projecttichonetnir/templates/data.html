        <h1> Watching a movie is one of the common pastimes! </h1>
    </div>
    <p>
        Nowadays watching movies has become a very popular thing and more and more films are being published. Today, film producers do not have a website that allows them to obtain statistics and factual data on films that have already been made. 
        
        I brought two databases, one of which is included in the budget
        Received by the film and the other included his income.
        Both databases also contain the summary of the film, the number of votes, the final rating from 1 to 10, the length of the film in minutes, its genre, its time of departure, what age
        It is allowed to view it, its name and number in the list (not a rating list)
    </p>
